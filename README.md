## Features

- **Blockchain Technology**: Utilizes blockchain for secure and immutable storage of votes.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Implements multi-factor authentication to enhance user identity verification.
- **Encryption**: Utilizes encryption to secure user data and votes.
- **Transparency**: Ensures transparency in the voting process, allowing users to verify their votes.
- **Immutability**: Guarantees that votes are immutable and cannot be altered once cast.
- **Verifiability**: Provides a mechanism for users to verify the authenticity of their votes.
